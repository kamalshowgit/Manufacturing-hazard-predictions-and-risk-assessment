# XGBoost Hazard Prediction - Detailed Problem Statement

## Problem Description

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using the XGBoost machine learning library to predict hazard values based on a set of input features. Hazard prediction has various applications, such as risk assessment, insurance pricing, and safety planning. In this scenario, we will be using historical data to train a model that can accurately predict hazard levels for new data instances.

## Data Description

You are provided with two CSV files:

- **Hazard_train.csv**: This file contains the training data. Each row represents a data instance, and each column represents a feature. The target variable, 'Hazard', indicates the hazard level associated with each instance. There are both numerical and categorical features in the dataset.

- **Hazard_test_share.csv**: This file contains the test data for which you need to make predictions. It has the same structure as the training data, without the 'Hazard' column.

## Problem Steps

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**:
   - Load the training and test data from the provided CSV files.
   - Display the first few rows of the training data to understand its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identify the categorical columns in the training data.
   - Combine the training and test data into a single DataFrame.
   - Process the categorical columns to create binary features for frequent categories.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Separate the combined data back into training and test datasets.

4. **XGBoost Model Building**:
   - Import the necessary libraries, including XGBoost.
   - Prepare the feature matrix (`x_train`) and target labels (`y_train`) for model training.
   - Define the XGBoost model parameters, including the objective function and evaluation metric.

5. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - Train the XGBoost model using the provided training data.
   - Validate the model using an appropriate evaluation metric.

6. **Prediction**:
   - Prepare the feature matrix (`x_test`) for the test data.
   - Use the trained XGBoost model to predict hazard levels for the test data instances.

7. **Submission File**:
   - Create a submission file in CSV format.
   - The submission file should contain a column for the data instance ID and a column for the predicted hazard values.
